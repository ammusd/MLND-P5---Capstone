Street View House Numbers
Project is built in five  following steps.

1.Download & Extract Data
2.Data Preprocessing
3.Data Plotting
4.Convnet Training
5.Convnet Testing 

Dataset:
This project uses the The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset. SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data preprocessing and formatting. SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.
This dataset is downloaded and extracted in the first step and preprocessed in the second step. The data plotting is done in the third step followed by the actual convolutional training and testing in next two steps.
